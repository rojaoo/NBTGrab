# NBTGrab

A simple Minecraft Fabric mod that allows you to copy the NBT data of items your hand to the clipboard. 

## Changes
This fork has two main (*and problably only*) changes:
- If the main hand is empty, it will copy the NBT data of the item in the off-hand (if there is one).
- Instead of showing the messages as toasts, it now shows a message in the chat.

## Credits
NBTGrab was originally developed by [luihum](https://github.com/luihum).
